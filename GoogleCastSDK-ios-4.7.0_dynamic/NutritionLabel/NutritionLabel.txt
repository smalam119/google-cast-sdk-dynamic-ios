App Privacy Details on the Apple App Store

Google is committed to helping our customers create great iOS 14 apps for end users. You may have read Apple’s announcement regarding the App Store’s new requirement for iOS 14 app developers to provide App Privacy Details. Apple has now released more details and the questionnaire itself. We’re invested in this together. We will be sharing information on whether and how our SDK handles end users’ data, including any applicable settings or configurations you can control as the app developer. While we will aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you, we won’t be able to speak for you, and you will ultimately be responsible for deciding how to respond to Apple’s questionnaire and whether to show end users any permissions or prompts described by Apple. We expect to have this information available soon, so check back often for updates.

The Cast SDK automatically collects certain data by default:

* Geographical location (country only) of the client, based on the public IP of the mobile phone.
* Device ID on every log upload.
* Diagnostic data to monitor and improve the reliability/performance of the SDK.

The Cast SDK collects certain data only if certain features are enabled or used:

* Usage data if the Cast SDK UI is used, including cast device selection and controlling media.
